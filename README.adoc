== Overview

Tfctl is a small Terraform wrapper for working with multi-account AWS
infrastructures where new accounts may be created dynamically and on-demand.

It discovers accounts by reading the AWS Organizations API and can assign
Terraform resources to multiple accounts based on the organization hierarchy.
Resources can be assigned globally, based on organization unit or to individual
accounts.  It supports nested OU hierarchies and helps keep your Terraform DRY.

Tfctl was originally developed to integrate Terraform with
https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone/[AWS Landing Zone] and
https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/[Control Tower] but should work with most
other ways of managing accounts in AWS Organizations.

== Features

* Discovers AWS accounts automatically.
* Automatically generates Terraform account configuration.
* Parallel execution across multiple accounts.
* Hierarchical configuration based on AWS Organization units structure.
* Supports per account configuration overrides for handling exceptions.
* Supports nested organization units.
* Terraform state tracking in S3 and locking in DynamoDB.
* Account targeting by OU path regular expressions.
* Automatic role assumption in target accounts.
* Works with CI/CD pipelines.

== Requirements

 * Terraform >= 0.12
 * Ruby >= 2.3
 * Accounts managed in AWS Organizations (by Landing Zone, Control Tower, some
   other means)

== Installation

To install the latest release from RubyGems run:

----
gem install tfctl
----

Alternatively you can build and install from this repo with:

----
make install
----

== Running tfctl

tfctl should be run from the root of the project directory.  It will generate
Terraform configuration in `.tfctl/`.

Anatomy of a tfctl command:

----
tfctl -c CONFIG_FILE TARGET_OPTIONS -- TERRAFORM_COMMAND
----

* `-c` specifies which tfctl config file to use (defaults to `tfctl.yaml` in
 current working directory if not set)
* `TARGET_OPTIONS` specifies which accounts to target.  This could be an individual
  account, a group of accounts in an organizational unit or all accounts.
* `TERRAFORM_COMMAND` will be passed to `terraform` along with any
  options.  See https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/index.html[Terraform
  commands] for details.

NOTE: You must have your AWS credentials configured before running tfctl or run
it using an AWS credentials helper such as
https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault[aws-vault].

=== Example commands

Show help:

----
tfctl -h
----

Show merged configuration:

----
tfctl -s
----

List all discovered accounts:

----
tfctl --all -l
----

TIP: This can be narrowed down using targeting options and is a good way to
test what accounts match.

Run Terraform init across all accounts:

----
tfctl --all -- init
----

Run plan in `test` OU accounts:

----
tfctl -o test -- plan
----

Run plan in `live` accounts assuming that `live` is a child OU in multiple
organization units:

----
tfctl -o '.*/live' -- plan
----

Run plan in an individual account:

----
tfctl -a example-account - plan
----

Run apply in all accounts:

----
tfctl --all -- apply
----

Run destroy in `test` OU accounts:

----
tfctl -o test -- destroy -auto-approve
----

Don't buffer the output:

----
tfctl -a example-account -u -- plan
----

This will show output in real time.  Usually output is buffered and displayed
after Terraform command finishes to make it more readable when running across
multiple accounts in parallel.
